## Automated Builds

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds on multiple platforms.

### Release Workflow

When pushing a new tag with a version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`), the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:

1. Build desktop applications for:

   - Windows
   - macOS (Universal Binary)
   - Linux

2. Build mobile applications for:

   - Android (APK)
   - iOS (IPA)

3. Create a draft release with all build artifacts attached

For detailed information about the CI/CD process and how to configure the necessary secrets for iOS and Android builds, see the [GitHub Workflows README](.github/README.md).
